# Discord-Bot
A simple discord bot that counts messages each user has sent. I made this to practice using the Discord API and JS.
To run:
1. Install dependecies such as discord.js
2. Add the bot to a server from the link provided in the txt file
3. Run `node app.js` to run. It will only start counting messages from the time it is introduced.

If you want to see the results, type `--check`, and it will return data.
This is the starting point for something much bigger.
